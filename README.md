# cluster_regulatization_public

### minimisation.mov
 This is an example on how the atomic features are minimized to cluster centers.
### basin_hopping.mov 
This ia an example basin hopping run where we alternate between cluster distance minimazation and energy relaxation.

### code/cluster_regulatization_mutations.py 
This is the mutation, copy it to your ase/ase/ga folder.

### code/featuregen.py
Convert ASE trajectory files to feature files.

### code/dist_energy_coor_histL2.py
Plot the cluster distance vs. energy correlation. 
Input are number of clusters, the trajectory file and the feature file.
